# Bank Queuing System Simulation

This project is one of my first real C++ projects, built as part of a university course.  
It helped me understand how to break down real-world scenarios into code and simulate them step by step.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ **Dynamic Customer Arrivals:** Random arrivals with realistic peak hours.
- ✅ **Multiple Tellers with Different Skills:** Each teller has unique skills and shifts.
- ✅ **Teller Breaks:** Automatic breaks during the day without affecting service flow.
- ✅ **Customer Service Time Tracking:** Calculates waiting and service times.
- ✅ **Average Transaction Duration:** Tracks average duration for each transaction type.
- ✅ **Smart Closing Rules:** Late-arriving customers are served or rejected based on closing time.
- ✅ **Clear Reporting:** Generates reports with average waiting times, transaction stats, served vs. rejected customers, and teller utilization.
